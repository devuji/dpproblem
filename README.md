Maximum Subarray Product with Constraint


Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray within it that has the largest product, subject to the constraint that the length of the subarray must be at least k and at most m, where k and m are given integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, where n is the length of the array. The array can contain both positive and negative integers, including zero.

Input: [2, -5, -2, -4, 3], k = 2, m = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: The subarray with the maximum product is [-2, -4, 3], which gives the product 24.

Input: [2, 3, -2, 4], k = 1, m = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray with the maximum product is [2, 3], which gives the product 6.

Input: [2, -1, 3, -2, -3, 4], k = 2, m = 4
Output: 36
Explanation: The subarray with the maximum product is [-2, -3, 4], which gives the product 36.


This problem combines several challenging aspects of dynamic programming, including:

Optimal substructure: Breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and finding the optimal solution for each of them.
State representation: Determining how to represent the state of the problem efficiently.
Handling negative numbers: Dealing with the possibility of negative numbers affecting the maximum product.
Constraining the subarray length: Introducing constraints on the length of the subarray adds complexity to the problem.
Edge cases: Considering edge cases where the entire array or segments of it might produce the maximum product.
Time and space complexity optimization: Achieving an efficient solution in terms of time and space complexity, especially for larger arrays.
